# morse-code

Languages & Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

A user types a word, character or number into the english input box, clicks the "translate" button and this is then converted to morse code, vice versa.

The english and morse characters are all stored in two seperate arrays and each character is looped through the array, using the index to find the correct translated character in the opposite array, the output is then displayed.

The code has been tested with Jest.
